# hello-world
This site was created to learn how to use GitHub. I happen to find  qigong interesting and useful.
I am adding this new text as a means of seeing how changes in branches eventually make their way to the main or source file.
I just made edits to the Main Read-me file thinking I was in the Edit file Read-me file... :/
